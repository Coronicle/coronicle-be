# Coronicle Backend

Coronicle is an app which allows users to first locally track their geo position. Once they are infected they can upload 
their traces to this backend. This allows all users to query with their own traces if they have been in close
contact to someone infected.

## Building the application

You need **Java 13** to run and build this application.

Execute `./mvnw clean install` to build the project.
